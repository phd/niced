.SH NAME

\fBniced\fP - a daemon renicing new and existing processes

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBniced\fP is a daemon which monitors new (using the Linux netlink connector)
and existing processes and changes their 'niceness' according to configured
rules.

It supports modification of processes' \fBnice\fP, \fBionice\fP and
\fBoom_adj\fP/\fBoom_score_adj\fP properties.

This daemon was inspired by the \fBrenice\fP project and the configuration file
should be backward compatible.

.SH DAEMON

\fBsystemd\fP service is provided:

.IP
.nf
$ sudo systemctl enable niced.service
$ sudo systemctl start niced.service
.fi

.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBniced\fP [\fB--config-file\fP PATH] [\fB-h\fP|\fB--help\fP]

.TP
\fB--config-file\fP
use given configuration file instead of \fB/etc/niced.conf\fP

.SH CONFIGURATION

Configuration is stored in the \fB/etc/niced.conf\fP file.

Modifying \fBniced\fP behavior:

- \fB@full_scan_interval = N\fP
  in seconds, default is \fB10\fP
.br
- \fB@verbose = N\fP
  \fB-2\fP silent,
\fB-1\fP quiet,
\fB0\fP default,
\fB1\fP yes,
\fB2\fP very,
\fB3\fP debug

Lines beginning with \fB#\fP are comments.

.SS CONFIGURATION RULES

Syntax:
    \fBactions\fP \fBpattern\fP

Actions can be separated with a comma, or written together without separators.

.SS ACTIONS

Syntax:
    \fBaction\fP[\fBparameter\fP]

Actions and parameters:

- modifiers:
    - \fBI\fP - case-insensitive pattern
    - \fB!\fP - forced rule, reapplied every full scan
    - \fBR\fP - recursive: \fB1...\fP, default is \fBinf\fP

- nice:
    - \fBn\fP - nice: \fB-20...19\fP, default is \fB10\fP

- ionice:
    - \fBr\fP - realtime ionice: \fB0...7\fP, default is \fB4\fP
    - \fBb\fP - best-effort ionice: \fB0...7\fP, default is \fB4\fP
    - \fBi\fP - idle ionice: \fB0...7\fP, default is \fB4\fP

- oom:
    - \fBo\fP - oom_adj: \fB-17...15\fP, default is \fB0\fP
    - \fBO\fP - oom_score_adj: \fB-1000...1000\fP, default is \fB0\fP

.SS PATTERNS

Patterns are regular expressions, case-sensitive by default.

If your pattern begins with \fB^\fP or \fB(\fP, it is matched literally. This
means you have to keep in mind a potential full path before the executable name
or the parameters after it.

Otherwise \fBniced\fP takes care of those for you by enclosing your pattern with
the following regular expression syntax:

\fB(^|[^\\s]*/)\fP and \fB(\\s|$)\fP
